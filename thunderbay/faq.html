            <p><strong><i><span>I am looking for membership prices. How much does it cost to join?</span></i></strong><br><br>Pricing will vary depending on your location, but the average cost of monthly membership is $36.50 in the United States and $49 in Canada. Club dues, monthly fees and any additional charges are specific to each independently owned gym.

Do you offer family or joint membership options?</span></i></strong><br><br>At Thunder bay, you’ll find varying membership options dependent on your location. Some gyms offer 6, 12 and 18-month options, but you’ll need to check with your local Thunder bay to learn about the different types of membership plans available.

Our community is our priority and we are happy to offer student, senior and military discounts as well as insurance discounts. However, it is up to each location to opt-in to offer the discount. It’s always best to check with your local club directly to learn what discounts are available near you.

            <p><strong><i><span>What is your cancellation policy? Is there a fee for breaking my contract?</span></i></strong><br><br>If you are interested in more information on how to suspend membership or put a hold on your account, you’ll need to reach out directly to your home club. Each of our locations are independently owned and operated and may have a slightly different policy regarding suspended memberships.  We look forward to continuing making healthy happen with you!

            <p><strong><i><span>Can I transfer my membership to another club location if I am moving soon?</span></i></strong><br><br>Yes! You absolutely can. All memberships are transferrable whether by usage or relocation. Relocation transfers must be more than 10 miles from your last residence. You won’t incur a transfer fee which means there’s no need for a specific moving policy. However, if you change your home gym—rates could change depending on your monthly dues.

Making healthy happen should be as easy as possible and the option to take a quick shower after a workout is sometimes the difference between “I can work out” and “I can’t work out.” While all clubs have showers and bathrooms, not all locations offer lockers.
